```php
$file = new UploadedFile($_FILES['myfile']);
// Setting up necessary requirements.
$file->max = 1024 * 1024;
$file->extensions = ['png', 'gif', 'jpg'];
$file->types = ['image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/jpeg'];
// Checks the uploaded file.
if ($file->validate())
{ 
  // No errors.
  ...
}

  // Shows error message.
  echo $file->getErrorMessage();
}
```

### **move()**

```php

$file->max = 1024 * 1024;
$file->extensions = ['png', 'gif', 'jpg'];
$file->types = ['image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/jpeg'];
// Setting up new destination folder.
$file->destination = '/path/to/new/directory';
// Checks and moves the uploaded file.
if (false !== $info = $file->move())

  // No errors.
  print_r($info);
}
else
{
  // Shows error message.
  echo $file->getErrorMessage();
}
```

The above example can output the following result:

```
Array
(
    [path] => /path/to/myfile
    [name] => myfile
