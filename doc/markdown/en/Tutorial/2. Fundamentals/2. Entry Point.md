# Framework's entry point #

After installing of the framework the root directory of a site should have file **connect.php**. This file is the entry point to the framework. Its content is as follows:

```php
<?php

use ClickBlocks\Cache;

// This line is necessary for correct work of the framework
// when you run the script from the console.
$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] = __DIR__;

// Includes the main class of the framework.
require_once(__DIR__ . '/Framework/clickblocks.php');

// Initializes the framework.
$cb = CB::init();

// Loading of the main application config.
$cb->setConfig(__DIR__ . '/Application/_config/config.ini');
// Loading of the local (development) application config.
$cb->setConfig(__DIR__ . '/Application/_config/.local.ini');
// Launching of the garbage collector with the given probability if it set.
if (!empty($cb['cache']['gcProbability'])) $cb->getCache()->gc($cb['cache']['gcProbability']);
```

If you want to move **connect.php** in a different directory, you will need to specify the correct path to the root directory of a site in `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']`.

During framework's initialization the following basic actions perform:
- Set error and exception handlers. The level of error sensitivity is set to **E_ALL**.
- If the variable `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']` is not defined (for example, if the script is run from the console), then value of this variable will be equal the directory of file **clickblocks.php**. You should take this into consideration if you plan to use a non-standard configuration of framework's folders.
- Value of the variable **$siteUniqueID** (unique identifier of the application) is set to md5 of value of the variable `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']`.
- Start of session.
- Set timezone according to settings of php.ini. If the timezone is not set in php.ini then zone UTC will be used.
