Building RESTful APIs
=====================



An Application Program Interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and
tools for building software applications. A good API makes it easier to develop
a program by providing all the building blocks, which a developer can then use
to put the blocks together. Web APIs allow the transmission of data and actions
across different web applications and sites security and through a language
agnostic interface.

There are several different methods for building an API. One of the leading
methods is Representational State Transfer (REST). The common properties of
REST:

-   Returns data, doesn't expose methods.

-   Supports JSON.

-   Uses explicit HTTP verbs.

-   Point to point connections.

-   Ajax (JavaScript) friendly.

-   Stateless.

The framework has the special class `ClickBlocks\Net\API` for building APIs
matching all properties mentioned above. This class provides the basic
functionality of any API such as:

-   Routine map.

-   Access to the current HTTP request data and control of the headers and body
    of the current response.

-   Automatic converting input and output data according to the given format.

-   Error and exception handling.



Entry Point
-----------



To create your own API system first you need to define a core class of your API
system which should be inherited from `Clickblocks\Net\API` class.
