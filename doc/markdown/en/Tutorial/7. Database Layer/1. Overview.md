# Overview #

Database layer in the ClickBlocks framework consists from three main parts:
- Class **ClickBlocks\DB\DB** that intended for providing the access to database's data via PDO (PHP Data Objects) extension. This is the main class of the database layer of the framework. Because the class uses PDO extension your application can be easily switched between different DBMS without the need to modify the data accessing code.

- **SQLBuilder** - this is the group of classes offering the object-oriented approach for building DBMS-independent SQL queries, which helps reduce risk of SQL-injections.

- Class **ClickBlocks\DB\AR** - the representation of the Active Record Design pattern. According this pattern a database table or view is wrapped into a class. Thus, an object instance is tied to a single row in the table. After creation of an object, a new row is added to the table upon save. Any object loaded gets its information from the database. When an object is updated the corresponding row in the table is also updated. The wrapper class implements accessor methods or properties for each column in the table or view.
